Really gay games tile game concept. This is a mobile game that was built using Unity. As you can see towards the end the characters will collide. Need a good implementation for the characters to be aware of each other while they are moving. The main character Thistle is part of another game that I was working on with Christian. This is a shaped-based concept game where Thistle needs to boost into the divots of the enemies to kill them.
